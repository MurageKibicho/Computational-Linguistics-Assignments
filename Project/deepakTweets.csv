intelligence or mind whether biological or artificial is not the same as consciousness  the mind of a baby or kindergarten child is not the same as that of a phd in neuroscience  however it is the same consciousness
what is it that knows there is a brain  the brain is a symbolic representation of mind  mind brain body universe are known in consciousness consciousness is just the capacity to know & experience in all living beings a paramecium does not have a brain
consciousness is not the same as mind

the evidence is fully consistent with both our perspectives that a change in the brain an incomplete representation of mind correlates with a change in mental experience is expected yet what is the brain we are talking ontology which the evidence doesnt address

happy easter dear friends  the symbolic language of the crucifixion is the death of the old paradigm resurrection is a leap into a whole new way of thinking
god is not a dead white male or imagined deity in the wisdom traditions of the east and those engaged in contemplative practices god is the immeasurable potential as infinite consciousness for the knowing & experience in every sentient beingwe need consciousness to do science
xoxoxo
yes id say its a good framework if consciousness is nonlocal then mind is localizing and brain is localized the caveat is that brainmind r not complementary though we often use it as such confuses materialists mind is much more vast and brain is a subset
yes mind is localized but also collectiveas in the internet minds are entangled and species specific embodied & relationalhuman minds create models  mathematics science philosophy religion technology systems of thought their source like all minds is consciousness
xoxo
fundamental reality is consciousness having an experience as sensations perceptions images  feelings & thoughts  modified activities of consciousness  mind brain body universe & god as imagined deity are human constructs
if by god means an imagined deity she is correct  if god is pure consciousness  then infinite possibilities remain as we evolve in consciousness  evolution now is meta biological it is the evolution of consciousness and of the consciousness of consciousness
brain development is a result of experience in consciousness  the brain is created by genes and sculpted by experience  relationships and social interactions in the entangled mind
god is pure consciousness in eastern contemplative traditions its our daily practice in meditation to go beyond subject object split the brain is known to consciousness alone all  evidence  requires consciousness even the search for evidence is in consciousness

humans are a fragmented mind only by going beyond subject object split can we know cosmic mind as truth it is love not as a sentiment but as unity consciousness

by giving names to colors & sensations arising in consciousness through self interaction & interpreting them as forms humans create the notion of objects in a physical world in reality there is only consciousness knowing itself as sensations images feelings & thoughts
in every moment the world is a reflection of the conditioned mind
just as water remains water appearing as raindrop rainbow cloud glacier river ocean and puddle consciousness remains consciousness appearing as manifold and diverse world appearances in every sentient being
deepak explains the 11 laws of reality in the next episode of our lectures and conversations video series
the source of every experience every perspective every opinion  every perception is consciousness
yes
consciousness is without cause impersonal irreducible the source of all perceptions all volition in all living species
hope is a sign of despair being is independent of hope & despair in moments of silence there is spontaneous creativity
death happens to the experience that we call body mind  consciousness is non local and not subject to birth or death that which we call a person is a transient process in consciousness
when all notions of reality are dropped reality reveals itself  thought creates subjectobject split overshadowing the reality of the one mind love is not a sentiment but ultimate truth as unity consciousness
first there was the word and the word was made into flesh  words create relative truth  absolute truth is silence  gods language is silence everything else is poor translation  rumi
tell me about un standard chicanery id like to try it
all names & forms are transient patterns of timeless formless being  the true self
when terrorism racism bigotry prejudice hatred trade wars climate change extinction of species mechanized death gun violence extreme nationalism ethnocentrism & gangster global leaders become the norm we must address our collective insanity urgently or face extinction
the necessity for god is the fact that we cant do anything without experience all the experience is in the mind and the mind is an activity in consciousness what we call matter is the interpretation of an experience on consciousness
so the question is what might that fickleness suggest about what we truly are beyond the mask of changing identities

neuroscientist on the perception  hallucination distinction
the brain is a symbolic representation of the conditioned mind  consciousness is witness to both mind and its constructs  mind brain and universe are a unified experience in consciousness
consciousness is that which is aware of all experience consciousness cannot be explored objectively because it is doing the exploring  self awareness is the only way to know it  being aware of being aware
how does a 3 pound piece of meat create concepts  imagination  intuition insight  creativity  choice intention  introspection  debate  perspective  disagreement  agreement  respect  envy  desire to know & do neuroscience  the brain cannot even feel its own pain

experience in the form of sensations perceptions images feelings and thoughts is intangible evanescent transient & ungraspablewe reify experience by giving it names like space time & matter creating the notion of an objective world  everyday reality is a human construct
beyond the apparent diversity of form and phenomena and the relativity of all subject  object relationships is an underlying reality called awareness awareness differentiates as knower knowing & known awareness modifies itself as experience & as interpretation of experience
all experience happens now including the memory of the experience called then  now is the vivid lucid dream that consciousness projects as all minds  all bodies  all relationships & that which we call the universe of space time & matter

my history with science pseudoscience scientism skeptics cynics psuedoprofound bullshit and consciousness
when you confuse yourself with your selfie you have lost your soul
you are contradicting yourself  you are an apostle if scientism like my friend
says that science examines an observer independent world that is validated by observation  anyone sense a contradiction
the reality illusion is our playground upgrade it or downgrade it it is our choice dailydeepak
how to you validate objective  observer independent  truth without an observer  if such a world exists it is unknowable
recent study suggests that how fit you think you are affects your risk of death more than how fit you actually are harvardhealth
the main course is silence
the observer & the observed are one krishnamurti

ultimate reality is neither subjective nor objective but transcendent potential
the universe lives through us and is fully alive and self aware in us
our only purpose in life is to find our innermost glory and unfold its infinite potential in space and time
the mind created language to express meaning  the brain adapted to make it possible  mind and brain are modified forms of consciousness
then unseen invisible reality the source of all that exists is knowable through your own awareness  it is awareness before thought or perception arises

fundamental reality cannot be expressed in words or even mathematics or science as it is prior to space time and matter  we have to settle for symbols and models to begin to comprehend the transcendent  only in stillness can we rest in it and be it
as humans we are born into an already interpreted world of myths theology philosophy and science endlessly revising models of reality  reality is not a model  its the consciousness in which models are created destroyed and recreated

awareness can never be an object of perceptual or mental experience  it is always the subject  the entire range of finite experience arises & subsides in infinite awareness  you as infinite being cannot be squeezed into the volume of the body or span of a lifetime
karma  memory & desire  sanskara and vasana  are the egos journey through cosmic time until awakening
the eyes are an activity of awareness in awareness that localize the experience of seeing
check us out in italy
freedom is the realization that you are not a personthat which we call a person is a processa person is the matrix of relationships localizing as an evolving activity in space & timethe fundamental being in which this experience evolves is spaceless timeless & formlessbeing
if there is a desire to wake up the time is always now  if not we can continue to sleep walk and be mired in the web of illusion maya for as long as we enjoy the ride of joy & suffering  pleasure & pain
eyes of the soul
upon awakening into awareness experiences of near & far me & other past & future space & time birth & death are seen as perceptual trickswe are all modified reflections of awareness in awareness in the same way as an entire city is a reflection of light in the same mirror
because every day presents some kind of goal however small being on a path is inevitable is there one best path in life

an observer independent  consciousness independent  reality is neither verifiable nor falsifiable  that which we call the universe is a species specific  human  experience objective reality is a metaphysical idea
non local reality is transcendent  it is not a perceptual experience so yes non sense ical but real
the notions of mind brain body and universe are conceived constructed governed and come into existence in consciousness  you are that  tattvamasi
we are the source of all notions
mind body universe are human constructs for modes of knowing and experience in consciousness all biological organisms other than humans are also human constructs a giraffe does not know its called a giraffe in reality there is only consciousness having an experience of itself
all great changes are preceded by chaos the disruption we see in the world is the prelude to emergence lets all commit to a more peaceful just sustainable healthier and happier world we must become what we wish to see by transcending our limited tribal identities
your mind and body are not the containers of awareness but experiences in awareness tattvamasi
that which humans call mind brain body and universe are verbs not nouns nouns are conventions of language but do not reflect reality language thus creates the illusion of duality  in the stillness of a silent mind we see all is one activity in being meditation
for guaranteed success first love and then do what comes naturally
when we seriously examine that which we call an objective world it is not to be found  all there is  is the interpretation of perceptual activity both activities perception and interpretation are modifications of consciousness in consciousness tattvamasi

the dance of existence  youtube
swami sarvapriyananda and deepak chopra   discussion on vedanta  youtube
laws of nature are regularities of experience in consciousness mathematics is a symbolic representation of those regularities the universe itself including our experience of a changing body mind is a symbolic represention of consciousness there is only consciousness we are that
the claim that thought is produced by electrochemistry is itself a thought this would absurdly suggest that electro chemicals are self aware in reality chemistry and biology are not containers of awareness but symbolic representations and human constructs in awareness
we confuse our descriptions of existence with explanations of existencethere is in fact no explanation for existence or its innumerable manifestationsif you are not bewildered or gratefully surprised by the fact that you exist your humanity is incomplete gratitude is sacred
to experience existence without interpretation is closer to truth
the idea that the physical world exists as perceived by the senses & is independent of our experience & knowing of it is called naive realism although this is the basis of of science it is scientifically unsound an observer independent world cannot be validated or falsified
to live in gratitude for both existence and awareness of existence is to live a life that is both holy and healed
the divine within you is all knowing
awareness is the presence in which body mind and world are a changing experience experiences come and go awareness remains it is you  the unseen seer in the midst of ever changing scenery

for conflict resolution treat your adversary with respect recognize perception of injustice on both sides recognize fear on both sides refrain from belligerence do not discuss ideology learn to forgive & ask for forgiveness understand emotional intelligence
to turn your adversary into an ally ruthlessness without cruelty cunning without harshness patience without negligence sweetness without foolishness casteneda
do less and accomplish more by just being
no system of thought be it mythology religion theology philosophy or science can access reality since consciousness is the knowing element of existence only self awareness can
know yourself and also study
to look for awareness in a physical object such as the brain is futile because awareness is always the subject of experience including the experience of knowing a brain
as a person you are not the container of awareness but a changing process and experience in awareness
to rest in the clarity and wakefulness of being is freedom from the conditioned and separate mind

deep state is a state of consciousness similar to deep sleep
anything that has been given a name or description by humans is a construct or concept for a mode of knowing and experience in consciousness the raw experience is perceptual activity  to call it it a neuron a rainbow or a galaxy is meaning imbued to it by humans
spirit or consciousness is non local has no location in space or time it has nowhere to go to or come from it is always  now here   nowhere now here
what do you mean when you say  i  the bodymind is a changing process and not our true identity im sorry for your loss but do know that as consciousness she exists in you already and always will as long as there is love
do other animals communicate by giving names to experiences  before anything can be called an object it is a perceptual activity in consciousness occurring in consciousness known in consciousness & made out of consciousness

focus on relationship and not networking
your body is not a physical object but an activity of entangled relationships  you are the totality of relationships  biosphere trees stars moon earth fire wind sky space and time  you are the observation deck for the universe looking at itself from a unique perspective
every physical object is an idea transformed into perceptual activity in consciousness
by the time you perceive an object or an event including your own body it has already occurred you perceive only the past and the past is not here thats why the world including your body is a dreamscape  only you as awareness is always now you are the dreamer not the dream
every physical object is a selective perceptual activity in consciousness that ignores the wholeness of existence  every so called part is a moving activity of the whole  in that sense all selective knowledge is ignore ance of reality

your true self is infinite
existence can only come from existence  if non existence existed it would not be non existence
creativity belongs to us as breathing
everything that we call the physical world simultaneously exists as virtual invisible states  these virtual states are infinite possibilities in consciousness
everything we call a solid object from a rock to a tree or a galaxy is a collection of space time events in consciousness  known in consciousness & made out of consciousness  all forms are phenomena & all phenomena are the arising and subsiding of sensations in consciousness
the world of solid physical objects including our brains bodies and sense organs is the reification or mental congealing of a fundamental consciousness that is fluid flexible and infinitely malleable  when we transcend to this source level reality becomes subject to revision

matter is a useful construct for doing science and creating technology  its superstition to believe you are a material object  an observer independent reality is not to be found  only self awareness can give you a glimpse of reality

deep sleep is the window to cosmic consciousness cosmicconsciousness
true choice begins with awareness of the behavior your brain is trying to induce in you based on lifelong programming using a medium of neurochemical control selfawareness will set you free transcendance superbrain
qualia are the raw material of all experience reified as the concept of objective material reality
the true self is never born and is not subject to birth or death as it eternally evolves in the void of space and the dark of time
from human to metahuman
thanks  and  for story  is 3 cups a lot of coffee
body mind universe are the simulation of cosmic consciousness  the body is not the container of awareness its an changing experience in awareness  awareness is not contained in anything  it contains all knowing
scientists say your mind isnt confined to your brain or even your body quartz
individual identity is mistaken interpretation of perception  that which we call a person is a process in awareness an intermittent stream of perceptions and thoughts in themselves modifications of awareness awareness has no personality  it is knower knowing and known
i know dan siegel and have been to many scientific conferences  just our communication here on twitter shows that mind is both embodied and relational he is not talking here about consciousness which is the common ground of all experience including mind
if lonely ask yourself what is the you that feels separate from what  is the body mind separate from any experience  is awareness separate from its modifications as perception or cognition is air separate from your breath  is light separate from your eyes
i is not a person  i is that which experiences the process called person  you never experience a body mind only the present perception or its interpretation in awareness i is not in time  death is s construct based on mistaken identity
neither faith nor science are needed to know reality what is it that creates the notion of faith or the system of thought called science  consciousness precedes all experience including the experience of doing science  what came before  consciousness or science
consciousness is always now  there is no before or after  no one has ever experienced a past or a future except as the present thought
love beauty and truth are reality  everything else is misperception
if mind is understood as an embodied & relational process per that regulates the flow of energy & information in an ecosystem of living beings than all perceived reality can be seen as its projectionthe mind is the conditioning of consciousness recycling as culture
yes  the projection recycles through habit and memory  it evolves through self awareness and creativity
everything you think about physical reality is just that  a non physical thought we conceptualize perceptual activity  an activity of awareness as matter this may be a useful construct but bamboozles you into thinking you are the body there is no such thing selfawareness
how we create reality
reinvent the body  resurrect the soul  reimagine the world  shivohum
love beauty and & truth are fundamental reality

since the government shutdown affects the financial security of officials charged with border security is it safe for the country to continue with it
politics affects all our lives  how do you stay uninvolved  is speaking out your personal views wrong
why  are you saying some of us are not important
i disagree with you  matter is a human construct for perceptual activity in consciousness
love
is the government shutdown increasing or decreasing national security
physical  is a label given to perceptual activity that occurs in consciousness  is known in consciousness & is made out os consciousness
be a metahuman

read 7 stages of spiritual development to help you navigate the path
creator is also destroyer shiva
shiva and all deities are symbols of higher states of consciousness  archetypes
chaos and order are complementarities  you know one because you know the other
what who  defines
i believe that any definition of god is limiting  the infinite is inconceivable pure consciousness is the closest i can say in in words gods language is silence everything else is poor translation rumi
theres a disturbing trend in science to try and prove that human beings are machines do your genes run you or vice versa
everyday immortality
the entire taxonomy of existence from the periodic table to force fields and particles and theory of evolution are human constructs  fundamental reality is being  awarenece existence or the knowing self  creator of constructs
yes all definitions are
can terrorism be defeated by killing terrorists does not the ideology recycle as the terrorists  is there a cure to violence other than forsaking all violence  is the history of humanity mostly violent  now modern capacities & ancient habits threaten extinction  yes  no
if consciousness was physical you would be able to see it  its that which sees and also that which interprets what is seen  the scenery is the visible experience of the invisible seer
all those people are dead  their ideologies are not  violence merely exchanges uniforms and allegiances  perhaps empathy compassion and love starting with self and extending to others could heal  do not modern capacities to kill ensure no winner
consciousness localizes in humans as perceptual activity in the 300 nm range  being formless it is infinite as potential for experience  im sorry i sem idiotic to you but its ok  many others say the same  they and you could be right
all knowing of the world is knowing of the self all reaction to the world is reaction to the self in every moment the experience of the world is experience of the self  personal transformation is key to planetary transformation
jihad as sacrifice of ego  yes
ive been on a 6 hour flight and landing soon it was fun hanging out on this global thought network as my plane flew across america on a planet spinning at dizzying speeds & hurtling thru space while galaxies spun and spacetime was ripped apart faster than the speed of light

no objective scientific description of the universe is possiblewe ourselves are an activity of the universe we look at all qualities we ascribe to the universe are dependent on our knowing & experience of it within a narrow band of perceptual activity the universe is as we are
sensations images feelings thoughts intuition imagination colors perceptions are not material objects that have position mass or velocity  they are qualities of consciousness that are imagined as the physical body in a material world of space time and causality illusion maya
